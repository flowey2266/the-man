When I try to run any game, it either gives me an error or it doesn't respond. (I waited 10 minutes, nothing) image  I checked the log files... it seems to have something to do with Vulkan? I have an Intel GPU so it would be better to use Vulkan.. if I use OpenGL It doesn't respond again yuzu_log.txt  I'm not sure if it's something to do with my specs but I'll put them here anyway. CPU - Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4440S CPU @ 2.80GHz Memory - 4GB GPU - Intel(R) HD Graphics 4600
